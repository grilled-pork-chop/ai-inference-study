# AI Inference Interfaces

## Overview

Inference interfaces define how clients communicate with **inference servers** (systems that expose trained ML models for prediction) — exchanging inputs, parameters, and outputs.  
Choosing the right interface impacts **latency**, **concurrency**, **compatibility**, and **observability**.

!!! tip "Think of interfaces like transport layers for intelligence"
    Just as HTTP, TCP, or gRPC define how data moves, inference interfaces define how predictions flow between models, services, and clients.

Many production systems use **multiple interfaces simultaneously** — for example, exposing REST for external clients while using gRPC for internal service-to-service communication.

## Common Inference Interfaces

| Interface                        | Transport Layer             | Data Format            | Typical Use                    | Strengths                       | Weaknesses                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **REST**                         | HTTP/1.1                    | JSON / binary (Base64) | Web APIs, dashboards           | Simple, universal               | No streaming, higher overhead   |
| **gRPC**                         | HTTP/2 (Protobuf)           | Binary                 | Microservices, high throughput | Fast, multiplexed, type-safe    | Harder to debug, browser limits |
| **WebSocket**                    | TCP / HTTP Upgrade          | JSON / binary frames   | Real-time interaction          | Full-duplex, low latency        | Stateful, requires session mgmt |

## REST Interface

### Overview
The **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is the most common inference interface.  
Clients send an HTTP `POST` request with serialized input (e.g., JSON or multipart) and receive a JSON response containing model outputs.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Transport:** HTTP/1.1  
- **Encoding:** JSON (UTF-8) or Base64 binary  
- **Connection:** Stateless, short-lived  
- **Concurrency:** One request per inference  
- **Observability:** Tracing via OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, or APM  
- **Load Handling:** Cached, retried, and rate-limited by gateways  

**Architecture:**  
`Client → Reverse Proxy (Nginx/Envoy) → Inference Server → Model Runtime → Response`

**Authentication:** Bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth 2.0, mTLS


### Advantages
✅ Universal and simple  
✅ Mature tooling (Swagger, OpenAPI)  
✅ Human-readable and easy to debug  
✅ Easy integration with web frameworks  
✅ Ideal for low-throughput, human-facing services  
✅ Excellent client library support across all languages  

### Limitations
❌ Higher per-request latency due to connection overhead  
❌ No native streaming (token-by-token)  
❌ JSON overhead for large payloads (>1MB)  
❌ Binary data requires Base64 encoding (+33% size increase)  

!!! info "Typical Use Cases"
    - Web and mobile APIs  
    - Dashboard or monitoring queries  
    - One-shot predictions (classification, regression)  
    - Low-scale inference endpoints  
    - Public-facing APIs with broad client compatibility  

!!! warning "Typical Overhead"
    ~50–300 ms per request, breakdown:

    - DNS resolution: 20–120 ms (if not cached)
    - TCP handshake: 10–50 ms
    - TLS negotiation: 50–100 ms (HTTPS)
    - JSON serialization/deserialization: 5–30 ms
    - Network latency: variable by geography

!!! warning "Common pitfalls"
    - **Over-polling**: Clients polling for updates instead of using SSE/WebSocket
    - **Large JSON payloads**: Should use binary formats or compression
    - **Missing rate limiting**: Can overwhelm inference servers

---

## gRPC Interface

### Overview
**gRPC** is a binary RPC framework over HTTP/2 — the standard for **high-performance internal inference** across distributed systems.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Transport:** HTTP/2, multiplexed persistent streams  
- **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers (compact binary)  
- **Streaming Modes:** Unary, Server, Client, Bidirectional  
- **Observability:** Interceptors for tracing/metrics  
- **Load Balancing:** xDS, Istio, or Linkerd support  

**Architecture:**  
`Client → gRPC Channel → Router → Model Runtime (GPU/CPU)`

**Authentication:** mTLS, JWT tokens, interceptor-based auth

### Advantages
✅ Low latency, high throughput  
✅ Supports full streaming and multiplexed calls  
✅ Strong typing and schema validation  
✅ Ideal for distributed systems and microservices  
✅ Efficient binary encoding reduces bandwidth  
✅ Connection reuse eliminates handshake overhead  

### Limitations
❌ Harder to debug due to binary payloads  
❌ Requires code generation  
❌ Not browser-native (needs gRPC-Web)  
❌ Complex versioning across teams  
❌ Limited client library maturity in some languages

!!! info "Typical Use Cases"
    - Internal model inference APIs  
    - High-throughput distributed systems  
    - Streaming outputs from LLMs  
    - Cloud inference backends (Triton, Ray Serve, TensorFlow Serving)  
    - Microservice mesh architectures  

!!! success "Performance"
    3–10× faster than REST depending on workload:

    - Unary calls with small payloads (<10KB): 2–3× faster
    - Large binary payloads (>1MB): 5–10× faster
    - Streaming workloads: 10–20× more efficient

!!! warning "Common pitfalls"
    - **Version skew**: Protobuf schema mismatches between clients and servers
    - **Poor error handling**: Binary errors harder to debug without proper logging
    - **Load balancing**: L7 load balancers required; L4 won't distribute properly

---

## WebSocket Interface

### Overview
**WebSocket** provides a persistent, full-duplex TCP connection — ideal for **interactive inference** or **streaming outputs**.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Transport:** TCP (upgraded from HTTP)  
- **Message Format:** JSON or binary frames  
- **Connection Model:** Stateful and persistent  
- **Keepalive:** Ping/pong frames  
- **Error Recovery:** Client-side reconnect logic  

**Runtime Behavior:**  
Each connection maps to a live inference session, streaming:

- Incremental input/output  
- Status/progress messages  
- Control signals (cancel/resume)  

**Authentication:** Token-based auth during handshake, session validation

### Advantages
✅ Real-time, bidirectional communication  
✅ Low-latency message delivery (<10ms in optimal network conditions)  
✅ Efficient for token/audio streaming  
✅ Native browser and client support  
✅ Single persistent connection reduces overhead  

### Limitations
❌ Stateful connections require session management  
❌ Load balancing requires sticky sessions or consistent hashing  
❌ Connection interruptions need reconnection logic  
❌ No standard schema like OpenAPI  
❌ Memory footprint scales with concurrent connections  

!!! info "Typical Use Cases"
    - Conversational UIs and chatbots  
    - Token-by-token text streaming  
    - Real-time translation or transcription  
    - Interactive model sessions  
    - Live collaboration tools with AI assistance  

!!! warning "Latency"
    - <10 ms per message on stable, low-latency networks (regional).
    - Cross-continental latency adds 100–300 ms baseline.

!!! success "Scaling"
    With proper architecture (connection pooling, message brokers like Redis/Kafka, horizontal scaling with sticky sessions), WebSocket can handle millions of concurrent connections.


!!! warning "Common pitfalls"
    - **No reconnection logic**: Clients must handle disconnections gracefully
    - **Memory leaks**: Forgotten connections accumulate server-side
    - **Firewall issues**: Some corporate networks block WebSocket

## Streaming APIs

### Overview
**Streaming inference** sends results incrementally (token-by-token, frame-by-frame).  
Implemented using **SSE**, **WebSocket**, or **gRPC streams**.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Transport:** HTTP/2 or WebSocket  
- **Connection:** Long-lived and stateful  
- **Backpressure:** Client flow control  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Resume/reconnect support  

| **Protocol**                 | **Description**                 | **Example**                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** | Unidirectional stream over HTTP | OpenAI, Anthropic APIs        |
| **WebSocket**                | Bidirectional communication     | Real-time chat, transcription |
| **gRPC Stream**              | Persistent typed stream         | Triton, TensorFlow Serving    |


**Runtime Behavior:**
Streaming reduces perceived latency — clients receive **partial results** while inference continues.  
Async runtimes handle thousands of open streams efficiently.

**Behavior:** Output streams until inference completes or connection closes.

**Cost considerations:** Streaming can reduce perceived latency but may increase total connection time and bandwidth costs for cloud deployments.

**Authentication:** Token-based, often refreshed during long sessions

### Advantages
✅ Responsive, low-latency output  
✅ Long inference session support  
✅ Supports progressive decoding and real-time feedback  
✅ Works well with async frameworks (FastAPI, Node.js)  
✅ Reduces time-to-first-token for generative models  

### Limitations
❌ Stateful connections (complex scaling)  
❌ Harder to trace or retry partial results  
❌ Reconnection logic required  
❌ Clients must handle partial outputs and buffering  
❌ Connection lifecycle management adds complexity  

!!! info "Typical Use Cases"
    - Generative AI (text, audio, or video)  
    - Real-time model feedback loops  
    - Progressive rendering of results  
    - Continuous data ingestion (e.g., IoT devices)  
    - Long-running inference tasks with progress updates  

!!! warning "Common pitfalls"
    - **Backpressure ignored:** Fast producers overwhelm slow consumers
    - **No timeout handling:** Hanging streams consume resources
    - **Partial results:** Clients must handle incomplete outputs

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Overview
**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, defines a structured, bidirectional communication layer between **models, tools, and clients**.  
It standardizes **context management**, **capability discovery**, and **tool invocation** across AI systems.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Transport:** JSON-RPC over HTTP, WebSocket, or stdin/stdout  
- **Capabilities:** Dynamic and negotiated at runtime  
- **State:** Persistent session context  
- **Authentication:** Delegated to host environment  
- **Goal:** Model—tool interoperability  

**How It Works:**  
MCP servers expose **capabilities** (functions, data access, retrieval).  
Clients (LLMs/orchestrators) **discover and call** them dynamically via **session-based negotiation** — similar to plugin protocols.

**Authentication:** Delegated to transport layer, session-based validation

!!! example "Example Flow"
    1. Client initiates MCP session
    2. Server advertises available tools/capabilities
    3. LLM queries context or invokes tools
    4. Server executes and returns structured results
    5. Session maintains conversation history and state

### Advantages
✅ Unified standard for model—tool interaction  
✅ Context sharing across components  
✅ Protocol-agnostic (multi-transport)  
✅ Extensible for orchestration systems  
✅ Standardized capability discovery  

### Limitations
❌ Emerging standard with evolving ecosystem (as of 2024)  
❌ Not optimized for raw tensor transport  
❌ Session negotiation adds initial overhead  
❌ Limited production deployments and tooling  

!!! info "Use cases"
    - Agent frameworks and orchestration  
    - LLMs calling external APIs/databases  
    - IDEs and AI-assisted tools  
    - Multi-tool AI workflows  
    - Context-aware AI applications  

!!! warning "Common pitfalls"
    - **Over-abstraction:** Not all tools need MCP's complexity
    - **Session leaks:** Context accumulation without cleanup
    - **Tool versioning:** Capability changes break clients

| **WebSocket**     | 1–3 ms†            | 400–600 streams         | +10–20%  | Good        | Stateful      | Real-time interaction       |
| **Streaming/SSE** | <1 ms/chunk        | 200–500                 | +15–25%  | Medium      | Stateful      | Generative AI, progressive  |
| **gRPC Stream**   | <1 ms/chunk        | 600–1000                | +5–10%   | Excellent   | Stateful      | High-perf streaming         |
| **MCP**           | 5–15 ms            | 100–300                 | +20–40%  | Session     | Stateful      | Tool orchestration          |

!!! note "Interpretation"
    - Overhead varies by payload size: small payloads (<1 KB) may experience 100%+ overhead, while large payloads (>10 MB) see 20–30%.  
    - Values shown are **after initial handshake** — add 50–100 ms for connection establishment.  
    - Throughput assumes optimal async handling and minimal I/O contention.  
    - Latency excludes **model inference time** (GPU/CPU computation).


!!! tip "Practical Observations"
    - **gRPC** → Best for **high-throughput, low-latency** internal inference  
    - **REST** → Dominates **external and public-facing** APIs  
    - **WebSocket / SSE** → Ideal for **real-time generative workloads**  
    - **MCP** → Focused on **tool interoperability and contextual intelligence**

## Summary

The right interface depends on your specific requirements:

- **Start with REST** for simplicity and broad compatibility
- **Adopt gRPC** when performance and throughput become critical
- **Use WebSocket/SSE** for real-time, streaming workloads
- **Explore MCP** for context-aware, multi-tool AI systems

Many production systems combine multiple interfaces—using gRPC internally for performance while exposing REST externally for compatibility. The key is matching the interface to your latency, throughput, and integration requirements.
