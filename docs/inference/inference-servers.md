# AI Inference Servers

## Overview

Inference servers are specialized systems that host trained ML models and expose them for **prediction** via standardized APIs. They handle **model loading**, **request batching**, **resource management**, and **scaling**—abstracting deployment complexity from application developers.

!!! tip "Think of inference servers as model runtime environments"
    Just as web servers (Nginx, Apache) serve HTTP content, inference servers serve ML predictions with optimizations for throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

Choosing the right inference server depends on **model frameworks**, **hardware targets**, **performance requirements**, and **operational needs**.
