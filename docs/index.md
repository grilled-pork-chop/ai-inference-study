# AI Inference in Production

> A practical guide for backend engineers building, deploying, and operating AI models in real-world production environments.

---

## Purpose

This documentation is for backend engineers who want to **turn trained models into production-ready services**.

You will learn:

* How inference works and how to structure AI workloads
* How to serve models efficiently and reliably
* How to design scalable, maintainable architectures
* How to deploy, monitor, and secure AI services
* Practical examples and production-ready patterns

---

## Documentation Overview

The guide is organized into **progressive sections**, starting from the fundamentals and moving toward production examples:

---

### [Fundamentals](./00-fundamentals/00-introduction.md)
> Core concepts every backend engineer should understand before deploying AI.

* Introduction to AI inference
* Understanding **models and checkpoints**
* The **inference process** and lifecycle
* Common pitfalls in production
* GPU fundamentals and deployment targets
* Different workload types and their implications

---

### [Model Usage & Patterns](./01-models-usage-patterns/00-introduction.md)

> How to structure and deploy AI models in real-world systems.

* Single model APIs vs pipelines vs ensembles
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns
* Agentic systems and reasoning loops
* Latency and resource considerations

---

### [Inference Servers](./02-inference-servers/00-introduction.md)

> Choosing the right execution engine for your workload.

* Triton, vLLM, TGI, TorchServe, Ray Serve, Ollama
* Strengths, limitations, and trade-offs
* Real-world hybrid server examples

---

### [Architecture Patterns](./03-architecture-patterns/00-introduction.md)

> Organize your backend for reliability, scalability, and observability.

* Standard layouts for API → router → model servers
* State management strategies
* Scaling and load management
* Streaming / LLM-specific patterns

---

### [Deployment](./04-deployment/00-introduction.md)

> Production-ready deployment strategies for AI workloads.

* Containerization best practices
* Kubernetes and Helm patterns
* CI/CD for models with lifecycle management
* Edge and multi-tenant deployment considerations

---

### [Observability](./05-observability/00-introduction.md)

> Keep AI systems transparent and manageable.

* Key metrics and what to monitor
* Logging, tracing, and alerting
* Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry

---

### [Projects & Examples](./06-projects/00-projects.md)

> Concrete production-ready AI projects to learn from.

* Image classification APIs
* Streaming LLM chatbots
* RAG document Q&A pipelines
* Batch video analysis
* Multi-model ensembles
* Edge inference gateways
* Cost-optimized inference setups

---

### [References & Schema](./07-references/00-glossary.md)

> Everything you need to speak the same language.

* Glossary of AI terms (quantization, distillation, scaling, etc.)
* Model domain taxonomy (CV, NLP, Speech, Multimodal)
* Concept maps of the full AI lifecycle
