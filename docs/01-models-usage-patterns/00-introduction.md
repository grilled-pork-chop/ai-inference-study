# Model Usage Patterns

> How models are exposed, composed, and orchestrated in production backends.

---

## Purpose

This section focuses on **production engineering decisions** around model deployment, not model training.  
Understanding these patterns helps backend engineers:

* Choose the right architecture for latency, throughput, and cost
* Plan GPU and CPU usage efficiently
* Ensure reliability, observability, and scalability
* Maintain consistency across multiple models or services

---

## Key Concepts

- **Pattern = Deployment & orchestration style** for one or more models  
- Different patterns exist to optimize for **latency, reliability, and complexity**
- Selecting the wrong pattern can cause **GPU thrashing, OOM errors, high latency, or operational headaches**

## Patterns Covered

| Pattern          | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Model** | One model per endpoint                      |
| **Pipeline**     | Sequential orchestration of multiple models |
| **Ensemble**     | Parallel models with aggregated outputs     |
| **RAG**          | Retrieval-Augmented Generation              |
| **Agentic**      | Models + tools + reasoning loops            |
