# Deployment

> Production-ready deployment strategies for AI workloads.

## Why Deployment Matters

Deploying AI models is more than running scripts. Production systems require:

- Reliability under load  
- Scalable inference pipelines  
- Versioning and reproducibility  
- Observability and monitoring  

Deployment is **the bridge between research and real users**.

## Core Pillars

1. **Containerization** — reproducible environments and dependencies  
2. **Orchestration** — Kubernetes & Helm for scaling and updates  
3. **CI/CD** — automated testing, build, and deployment pipelines (GitLab CI)  
4. **Edge & Multi-Tenant** — serve models close to users or multiple clients

## Takeaway

> Deployment transforms AI research into a **robust, scalable, and observable service**.
