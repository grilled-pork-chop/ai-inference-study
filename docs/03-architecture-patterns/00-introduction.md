# Architecture Patterns

> How to structure your AI inference backend for reliability, scalability, and observability.

## Why It Matters

Deploying a model is only step one. Real-world inference systems require:

* Predictable **latency** under load
* GPU sharing without contention
* Observability into every request and pipeline stage

Architecture patterns formalize how **API, inference service, and runtime** interact.  
They ensure your ML components act as *production-grade services*, not experimental scripts.

## Core Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separation of concerns** | Keep API, inference, and state management isolated  |
| **Horizontal scalability** | Prefer scaling out vs scaling up                    |
| **Observability-first**    | Logs, metrics, and traces are mandatory             |
| **Graceful degradation**   | Services should degrade predictably under high load |

## System Archetypes

| Pattern      | Use Case                         | Example Stack             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Monolithic   | Rapid prototyping / internal API | FastAPI + Ollama          |
| Microservice | Production inference             | Triton + K8s + Prometheus |
| Hybrid       | RAG pipelines, mixed workloads   | FastAPI + Redis + vLLM    |

## High-Level Architecture

    A[Client / API Gateway] --> B[Router]
    B --> C[Inference Service]
    C --> D[Model Runtime vLLM / Triton / Ollama]
    D --> E[Telemetry & Storage]
```

**Blocks:**

* **Gateway** — auth, rate-limiting, routing
* **Router** — selects model, version, or pipeline
* **Inference Service** — converts payloads → tensors, batching
* **Runtime** — executes model efficiently (GPU / CPU)
* **Telemetry** — metrics, logs, error tracking

## Takeaway

> Architecture patterns are about **discipline**: don’t just make models run, make them survive production.
